--==============================Part 1: Table Creation& Modification======================================
--1.Create a LARGE_PROPERTY table with the structure shown below, no primary keys are defined in this table.
/*
===Column Name == | ==Data Type===
|   OFFICE_NUM    |  DECIMAL(2)
|   ADDRESS       |  CHAR(25)
|   BDRMS         |  DECIMAL(2)
|   FLOORS        |  DECIMAL(2)
|   MONTHLY_RENT  |  DECIMAL(6,2)
|   OWNER_NUM     |  CHAR(5)

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS LARGE_PROPERTY;
CREATE TABLE LARGE_PROPERTY 
(
OFFICE_NUM DECIMAL(2), 
ADDRESS CHAR(25), 
BDRMS DECIMAL(2), 
FLOORS DECIMAL(2), 
MONTHLY_RENT DECIMAL(6,2), 
OWNER_NUM CHAR(5)
);

--2.Insert into the LARGE_PROPERTY table the office number, address, bedrooms, baths, 
--monthly rent, and owner number for those properties whose square footage is greater than 1,500 square feet.
INSERT INTO LARGE_PROPERTY (OFFICE_NUM, ADDRESS, BDRMS, FLOORS, MONTHLY_RENT, OWNER_NUM)
	SELECT OFFICE_NUM, ADDRESS, BDRMS, FLOORS, MONTHLY_RENT, OWNER_NUM
		FROM PROPERTY
			WHERE SQR_FT > 1500;

--3.StayWell has increased the monthly rent of each large property by $150. 
--Update the monthly rents in the LARGE_PROPERTY table accordingly.
UPDATE LARGE_PROPERTY
	SET MONTHLY_RENT = MONTHLY_RENT + 150;

--4.After increasing the monthly rent of each large property by $150 (Exercise 3), 
--StayWell decides to decrease the monthly rent of any property 
--whose monthly fee is more than $1750 by one percent. 
--Update the monthly rents in the LARGE_PROPERTY table accordingly.
UPDATE LARGE_PROPERTY
	SET MONTHLY_RENT = MONTHLY_RENT * 0.99
		WHERE MONTHLY_RENT > 1750;

--5.Insert a row into the LARGE_PROPERTY table for a new property. The office number is 1, 
--the address is 2643 Lugsi Dr, the number of bedrooms is 3, the number of floors is 2, 
--the monthly rent is $775, and the owner number is MA111.

INSERT INTO LARGE_PROPERTY (OFFICE_NUM, ADDRESS, BDRMS, FLOORS, MONTHLY_RENT, OWNER_NUM)
	VALUES (1, '2643 Lugsi Dr', 3, 2, 775, 'MA111');

--6.Delete all properties in the LARGE_PROPERTY table for which the owner number is BI109.
DELETE FROM LARGE_PROPERTY
	WHERE OWNER_NUM = 'BI109';


--7.The property in managed by Columbia City with the address 105 North Illinois Rd is 
--in the process of being remodeled and the number of bedrooms is unknown. 
--Change the bedrooms value in the LARGE_PROPERTY table to null.
UPDATE LARGE_PROPERTY

		WHERE ADDRESS = '105 North Illinois Rd.';


--8. Delete the LARGE_PROPERTY table from the database.
DROP TABLE LARGE_PROPERTY;





--==============================Part 2: Views, Procedures and Triggers======================================
-- 9. Create a Stored Procedure DISP_OWNER_YOURFIRSTNAMELASTNAME (E.G. DISP_OWNER_JIAOWANG).
--This SP takes a single parameter/variable named I_PROPERTY_ID to store user input value of a PROPERTY_ID. 
--It should output OFFICE_NUM, ADDRESS, OWNER_NUM and OWNER_NAME (concatenated FirstName LastName in proper format) 
--from the PROPERTY and OWNER tables for the given PROPERTY_ID
CREATE PROCEDURE DISP_OWNER_TROYSMITH @I_PROPERTY_ID INT
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT P.OFFICE_NUM, P.ADDRESS, P.OWNER_NUM, CONCAT(O.FIRST_NAME, ' ', O.LAST_NAME) AS OWNER_NAME
   		FROM PROPERTY P INNER JOIN OWNER O ON P.OWNER_NUM = O.OWNER_NUM
   			WHERE P.PROPERTY_ID = @I_PROPERTY_ID;
END;



-- 10. Create a Stored Procedure UPDATE_OWNER_YOURFIRSTNAMELASTNAME (E.G. UPDATE_OWNER_JIAOWANG).
--This Stored Procedure takes 2 parameters/variables:  
--I_OWNER_NUM to store user input value of a OWNER_NUM, and I_LAST_NAME to store user input value of a new LAST_NAME. 
--This stored procedure should update/change the last name to the given value, for the given owner num.
CREATE PROCEDURE UPDATE_OWNER_TROYSMITH @I_OWNER_NUM CHAR(5), @I_LAST_NAME CHAR(25)
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE OWNER
    SET LAST_NAME = @I_LAST_NAME
    WHERE OWNER_NUM = @I_OWNER_NUM;
END;
